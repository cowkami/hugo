# Bayes theorem

Let$x$and$y$be random variebles, then they satisfy

$$
p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}.
$$

This theorem can be easily obtained by a	transformation of joint probability equation as the following.

$$
\begin{gathered} \\\
p(x, y) &= p(y, x) \\\
\iff p(x|y)p(y) &= p(y|x)p(x)  \\\
\iff p(x|y) &= \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}.
\end{gathered}
$$
