# Bayes theorem

Let $$x$$and$$y$$  be random variebles, then they satisfy

$$
p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}.
$$

This theorem can be easily obtained by a	transformation of joint probability equation as the following.

$$
&& p(x, y) = p(y, x) \iff p(x|y)p(y) = 
p(y|x)p(x)
\iff p(x|y) =
\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}.
$$
