# install emacs
 Actually, I'm a vimmer.
But I also had wanted to use emacs for a long time, because I love Lisp and emacs is the best text editor for writing Lisp.
So, I installed emacs on my MacBook Air(m1).
When you use emacs, you must use control key and Meta key frequently.
And the key's positions are most important thing to lead your happy emacs life.

## remapping
 I always set left_control on caps lock; left of A key.
And it's the best for not only other than emacs,  but also emacs I think.
Then, my concern is which key is the best for Meta.
Meta works a little bit different or inversely for control, so it should be nearby control and easy to access for my finger.
So, I chosen left command key, left option is not bad but my left thumb is gonna die.
 Firstly, I remapped left command to left option on iTerm2 configuration.
`Preferences > Keys > Remap modifiers`
Second, set Left Option key to send Esc+ signal.
`Preferences > Profiles > Keys > General`

Thus, I got the perfect emacs key mapping!
